This can be used to replace some face-to-face appointments where appropriate, or used alongside face-to-face appointments to help manage risk."

Thanks to the users who reported this was slowing them down.\n\nTo make it easier for you to upload files, we’ve made some technical changes so that you can add one file at a time to an appointment outcome.\n\nYou can now arrange planned telephone contacts (NS) without needing to select a location. This fixes a bug that was causing errors."
